## Description
For two strings `s` and `t`, we say "t divides s" \
if and only if `s = t + t + t + ... + t + t` (i.e., `t` is concatenated with itself one or more times).

Given two strings `str1` and `str2`, return the largest string `x` such that `x` divides both `str1` and `str2`.
**Constraints:**
- `1 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 100`
- `word1` and `word2` consist of lowercase English letters.
